To download the charge density of the Materials Project, you can use the `download_mp.py` code. In the middle of the code, you have to write your own api key to download the mp-dataset. The api key can be obtained in the (official MP)[https://next-gen.materialsproject.org/api] sites. To download code simply, use `python download_mp.py`.

`mpids_query.json` includes the all possible materials ids that has `HasProps.charge_density` property. The length of the total mpids are 120,775. If this file causes error, then give options `--download_mpids=True`. This flag will rebuild the mpids_query.

`mp-ids-except.txt` includes the some ids which cause the error when download the charge density data. (I guess this error arised since some materials have wrong flag in `HasProps.charge_density`) 3,240 ids throw error when I downloaded data. This file will be automatically generated by capturing error.

After excludes the error materials, all total materials will be 117,535. The train, valid and test splits are included in `../data_split`.

FYI, I implemented indexing flags in `download_mp.py`, so you can use it to distributed download (multi-server) or resume the downloads.

### Example - distributed download
```
# svr1
python download_mp.py --start 0 --end 3000
# svr2
python download_mp.py --start 3000 --end 6000
# svr N
python download_mp.py --start 6000
```

### Example - resuming the download
```
python download_mp.py -- start {failed index number}
```
